Ironmaster
==========

An Erlang server management app.

Aims:
-----

The aim of this project in the short term is to have a self-contained erlang
application that can manage complex server setups. Why Erlang? All the rest of
the stack is written in erlang, so we can distribute it more easily, which
although it is not a requirement for Ironmaster, will be very helpful.
